things mistaken for bridges: (0 - 1700)
- intersections, especially with traffic jams
- harbors, or dead-end roads pointing to the sea on beaches (piers, docks, quays, cranes and roads leading to them)
- road along a body of water, near dead-end water ways
- road markings on large tarmac surfaces (runways), zebra crossings
- trail connecting patches of sand, crops, or grass (in argrigarian/rural areas)
- ships, boats, or ferries
- long islands along rivers
- concourses of runways
- power lines??

Other issues:
- dark images that looks like marshland make it more difficult for the model
- bbox of long bridge are too short
- bbox of short bride are too wide
- salt lakes or water storage for industrial gives very poor results
